## Building and running the simulator

This simulator by default uses a CMake based build system.
The advantage in using a CMake based build system is portability and dependency management.
We require CMake 3.0+ to build this simulator.
If `cmake-3.0` is not available,
we also supply a Makefile to build the most basic version of the simulator.

### Building

Doing out of source builds with CMake is recommended to avoid the build files cluttering the main directory.

```bash
# cmake out of source build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# Build dramsim3 library and executables
make -j4

# Alternatively, build with thermal module enabled
cmake .. -DTHERMAL=1

```

The build process creates `dramsim3main` and executables in the `build` directory.
By default, it also creates `libdramsim3.so` shared library in the project root directory.

### Running

```bash
# help
./build/dramsim3main -h

# Running random stream with a config file
./build/dramsim3main configs/DDR4_8Gb_x8_3200.ini --stream random -c 100000 

# Running a trace file
./build/dramsim3main configs/DDR4_8Gb_x8_3200.ini -c 100000 -t sample_trace.txt

# Running with gem5
--mem-type=dramsim3 --dramsim3-ini=configs/DDR4_4Gb_x4_2133.ini

```

The output can be directed to another directory by `-o` option
or can be configured in the config file.
You can control the verbosity in the config file as well.

During analysis, the trace files where present in the folder tests. The custom configs which we used is present in the folder named custom_configs.

A bash script inside the build folder shows how to use the DRAMsim3 instrumented.
